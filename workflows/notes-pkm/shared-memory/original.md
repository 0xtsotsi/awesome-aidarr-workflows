# Shared Memory

Share memories from your knowledge base with other users. Manage users, groups, and fine-grained permissions on namespaces.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create user and group
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh create-user mark
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh create-group family
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh add-member family mark

# Grant access
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family read christine/shared/
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family update christine/shared/
```

## Namespace Organization

```
<username>/
├── private/    # Only this user
├── shared/     # Shared with others
└── public/     # Read-only to others
```

Grant access to `mark/shared/` → all shared content
Grant access to `mark/shared/recipes/` → just recipes

```bash

{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh create-user mark

# Create family group
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh create-group family
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh add-member family mark

# Grant mutual access to shared/ namespaces
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family read christine/shared/
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family create christine/shared/
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family update christine/shared/
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family read mark/shared/
{baseDir}/scripts/shared-memory.sh grant group family update mark/shared/
```

## Troubleshooting

If commands fail, first check if an Ensue API key is configured:

```bash
echo $ENSUE_API_KEY
grep -A2 'ensue-learning-memory' ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json
```

If no API key found, tell user to get a free key at https://www.ensue-network.ai/login and configure in `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "ensue-learning-memory": {
        "apiKey": "their-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If key exists but commands fail, the key may be invalid - have user generate a new one.
