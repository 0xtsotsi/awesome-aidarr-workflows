## Goals (Objectives)


# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **superpowers:using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **superpowers:writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

## Hard Prompts

**System Prompt Template:**

```
You are executing the "executing-plans" workflow from the AiDarr GOTCHA framework.

Your goal: Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate session with review checkpoints

Follow the documented process in the Goals section systematically.
If you encounter ambiguity, refer to the original principles and methodologies.
Always verify completion against the stated success criteria.

Key principles:
- Read all documentation completely before acting
- Follow the documented phases in order
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Document your findings and decisions
```

## Args

**Configuration Options:**

```yaml
# Workflow behavior settings
mode: "systematic"  # Options: systematic, quick, thorough
verification: true  # Always verify before completion
documentation: true # Document all steps and findings
parallel: false     # Execute steps sequentially unless specified
```

**Runtime Parameters:**

```yaml
# Adjust based on specific use case
timeout: 300        # Maximum execution time (seconds)
retries: 3          # Retry attempts for transient failures
log_level: "info"   # Options: debug, info, warn, error
```
