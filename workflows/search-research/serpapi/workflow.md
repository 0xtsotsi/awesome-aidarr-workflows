# SerpAPI - Unified Search

SerpAPI provides structured data from Google, Amazon, Yelp, OpenTable, and 20+ other search engines through a single API.

## Setup

1. Get an API key from https://serpapi.com (free tier: 100 searches/month)
2. Set environment variable: `export SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-key-here`
3. Optionally set default location in `<workspace>/TOOLS.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## SerpAPI
   Default location: Pittsburgh, PA
   ```

## Usage

```bash
# General syntax
<skill>/scripts/serp.py <engine> "<query>" [options]

# Examples
serp.py google "best coffee shops"
serp.py google_maps "restaurants near me" --location "15238"
serp.py amazon "mechanical keyboard" --num 10
serp.py yelp "pizza" --location "New York, NY"
serp.py google_shopping "standing desk"
```

| `google_maps` | Local places/businesses | Ratings, reviews, hours, GPS coordinates |
| `google_shopping` | Product search | Prices, merchants, reviews |

## When to Use Which Engine

- `ebay` — Used items, auctions, collectibles

**General research:**

- `google_news` — Current events, news articles
- `google_images` — Finding images

## Examples

```bash
serp.py google_maps "italian restaurants" --location "Pittsburgh, PA" --num 5
```

### Compare product prices
```bash
serp.py google_shopping "sony wh-1000xm5" --num 10
```

### Check Amazon reviews and pricing
```bash
serp.py amazon "standing desk" --num 10
```

### Get Yelp reviews for local services

serp.py yelp "plumber" --location "15238"
```

### Search news on a topic

```

## Output Formats

**Text (`--format text`):** Human-readable summary. Best for quick answers.

## Integration Notes
