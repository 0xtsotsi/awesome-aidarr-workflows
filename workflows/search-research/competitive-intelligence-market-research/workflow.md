12:00-13:00 | Market Sizing (Sales Tech, India Focus)

BOTTOM-UP APPROACH:

STEP 1: Define ICP
- B2B SaaS companies
- $1M-10M ARR
- 10-50 employees
- India geography
- Have sales team (5+ people)

STEP 2: Count Companies (FREE TOOLS)
□ LinkedIn Sales Navigator (free trial):
  - Filter: "B2B SaaS" + "India" + "10-50 employees"
  - Count: ~2,500 companies

□ Crunchbase (free tier):
  - Filter: "B2B" + "India" + "$1M-10M funding"
  - Count: ~1,800 companies

□ Cross-reference: ~2,000 companies (conservative)

STEP 3: Estimate Deal Size
□ Research 10 competitor pricing pages
□ G2 reviews mentioning price
□ Assume: $5K average annual contract value

STEP 4: Calculate SAM
2,000 companies × $5,000 = $10M SAM (India only)

VALIDATION:
- Does this feel right for India B2B SaaS sales tech?
- Cross-check: Wingman (Indian competitor) raised $X, implies $Y market
- Sense check with 3 sales leaders: "Does $10M India market sound right?"

TOP-DOWN VALIDATION:
- Global sales enablement: $5B (Gartner)
- India = ~1.5% of global B2B SaaS market
- $5B × 1.5% × 30% (conversation intel subset) = ~$22M
- Bottom-up $10M vs top-down $22M → Use conservative $10-15M SAM

# 📊 SECTION B: HR TECH COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

**When To Use This Section:**
- Your product: HRIS, employee engagement, performance management, recruiting, learning
- Your competitors: Workday, BambooHR, Culture Amp, Lattice, Lever, Greenhouse
- Your buyers: HR leaders, CHROs, People Ops
- Your go-to-market: Typically sales-led (HR is relationship-driven)

---

## **B1: HR Tech @ Series A (Founder-Led Research)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $2M-8M ARR, 20-80 employees
- Stage: Series A, early PMF
- You: Founder (often ex-HR tech or HRBP background)
- Budget: $0-300/month
- Timeline: 1 week for competitive positioning
```

### **The HR Tech Competitive Landscape (Different from Sales Tech):**

**Key Differences vs Sales Tech:**

```
SALES TECH:
- Buyers: Sales leaders (aggressive, data-driven, ROI-focused)
- Buying cycle: 1-3 months (fast)
- Decision: Individual or small team
- Risk tolerance: High (experiment with tools)

HR TECH:
- Buyers: HR leaders (relationship-driven, risk-averse, people-focused)
- Buying cycle: 3-9 months (slower, more deliberate)
- Decision: Committee (HR + Finance + Legal + IT)
- Risk tolerance: LOW (can't screw up people data)
```

**This Changes Everything About Competitive Research:**

```
FOR SALES TECH:
✅ Aggressive competitive positioning okay ("We're 10× cheaper than Gong")
✅ Fast iteration, experiment
✅ Attack incumbents publicly

FOR HR TECH:
❌ NEVER attack competitors (HR community is small, reputation matters)
❌ Conservative positioning only
❌ Professional tone mandatory (HR is risk-averse)
✅ Emphasize: Trust, security, compliance, relationships
```

### **Series A HR Tech Research: Conservative Approach**

**DAY 1-2: Competitive Landscape (But Make It Professional)**

```
09:00-12:00 | Map HR Tech Ecosystem

HR Tech has sub-categories (pick yours):
□ HRIS/Core HR: Workday, BambooHR, Rippling, Deel
□ Employee Engagement: Culture Amp, Lattice, 15Five
□ Performance Management: Lattice, Betterworks, 7Geese
□ Recruiting: Lever, Greenhouse, Ashby
□ Learning: Degreed, EdCast, Docebo
□ Comp & Benefits: Pave, Figures, Carta (equity)

INDIA-SPECIFIC HR TECH:
□ Darwinbox (India HRIS leader)
□ Keka (SMB HRIS)
□ EngageWith (employee engagement)
□ SumHR (payroll + HR)

RESEARCH SOURCES (HR-Specific):
□ SHRM (Society for HR Management) - not for competitive intel, but industry trends
□ HR Brew newsletter (industry news)
□ HR Tech Conference exhibitor list
□ G2 HR Software categories

12:00-13:00 | Pricing Research (HR Tech Nuance)

HR Tech pricing is DIFFERENT from Sales Tech:

SALES TECH: Per-seat, usage-based, transparent
HR TECH: Per-employee, bundled, often hidden

PRICING MODELS:
- BambooHR: $X/employee/month (SMB)
- Workday: Enterprise-only, no public pricing
- Culture Amp: $3-7/employee/month (from reviews)
- Lattice: $4-11/employee/month

YOUR POSITIONING:
"Affordable for SMBs" (if BambooHR is $6/employee, you're $3-4)
NOT: "10× cheaper" (too aggressive for HR)
```

**DAY 3-4: Feature Analysis (HR Compliance is Critical)**

```
HR TECH MUST-HAVES (Regulatory):

FOR INDIA MARKET:
✅ PF/ESI compliance (mandatory)
✅ Gratuity calculations
✅ Leave policy (Indian labor law)
✅ Payroll (statutory deductions)

FOR US MARKET:
✅ EEOC compliance (equal employment)
✅ ADA compliance (disability)
✅ FMLA tracking (family medical leave)
✅ 401K integration

FOR EU MARKET:
✅ GDPR compliance (data privacy)
✅ Works council integration
✅ Country-specific labor laws

COMPETITOR ANALYSIS (Compliance Focus):
□ Which markets does competitor support?
□ What compliance features do they have?
□ Do they have SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR certifications?
□ What do reviews say about compliance failures?

THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM SALES TECH:
Sales Tech: Compliance nice-to-have
HR Tech: Compliance MANDATORY (you lose deals without it)
```

**DAY 5: Positioning (Conservative, Professional)**

```
HR TECH POSITIONING RULES:

❌ DON'T SAY:
"We're crushing competitors"
"Workday sucks"
"10× better than X"

✅ DO SAY:
"Trusted by 500+ HR leaders"
"Built specifically for mid-market"
"Compliant, secure, easy to use"
"Recommended by SHRM members"

POSITIONING FRAMEWORK (HR Tech):
- Emphasize: Trust, security, compliance
- Tone: Professional, warm, supportive
- Avoid: Aggressive, sales-y, attacking

EXAMPLE POSITIONING:
"Culture Amp for Mid-Market Companies
 Affordable, compliant, built for HR leaders who care about their people."

Not: "Culture Amp is too expensive. We're cheaper."
```

### **HR Tech Specific: Conservative Battle Cards**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VS. CULTURE AMP (Category Leader)          │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WHEN TO POSITION AGAINST THEM:             │
│ • Mid-market companies (200-1000 employees)│
│ • Budget-conscious HR teams               │
│ • Need engagement + performance           │
│                                            │
│ NEVER SAY:                                 │
│ ❌ "Culture Amp is too expensive"          │
│ ❌ "We're better than Culture Amp"         │
│ ❌ "Culture Amp has bad customer support"  │
│                                            │
│ INSTEAD SAY:                               │
│ ✅ "Culture Amp is excellent for enterprise│
│    We're purpose-built for mid-market."   │
│ ✅ "We focus on X (performance management) │
│    Culture Amp is broader (engagement)."  │
│ ✅ "Mid-market companies love our pricing  │
│    and hands-on support."                 │
│                                            │
│ RESPECTFUL DIFFERENTIATION:                │
│ • We: Mid-market focus ($200-1K employees) │
│ • Them: Enterprise focus (1K+ employees)   │
│ • We: Hands-on support included           │
│ • Them: Self-serve + paid support tiers   │
│ • We: $3-4/employee/month                 │
│ • Them: $5-8/employee/month               │
│                                            │
│ WHY RESPECT MATTERS IN HR TECH:            │
│ - HR community is small (everyone knows everyone)│
│ - Today's competitor could be tomorrow's  │
│   integration partner or acquisition target│
│ - HR buyers HATE vendor trash-talk         │
│ - Culture Amp might refer customers to you │
│   for mid-market deals they don't want    │

## **B2: HR Tech @ Series B (Professional Research + Win/Loss)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $12M-40M ARR, 200-600 employees
- Stage: Series B, moving upmarket or expanding modules
- You: Director of Product Marketing or PMM
- Budget: $2K-6K/month for research
- Goal: Should we move upmarket? Which features to build?
```

### **Series B HR Tech: Different Questions Than Sales Tech**

```
SALES TECH @ SERIES B:
"Can we compete with Gong for mid-market?"
"Should we expand to US?"

HR TECH @ SERIES B:
"Should we add performance management to engagement?"
"Can we serve 1,000+ employee companies?"
"Do we need GDPR compliance for EU expansion?"
"Should we build AI features or partner?"
```

### **Week 1-2: Comprehensive HR Tech Competitive Analysis**

```
RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS:

1. MODULE EXPANSION ANALYSIS (HR Tech Specific)

HR Tech companies expand via modules:
- Start: Single point solution (e.g., just engagement)
- Expand: Add adjacent modules (engagement → performance)
- Platform: Full suite (HRIS → engagement → performance → learning)

COMPETITOR EVOLUTION EXAMPLES:
- Lattice: Started performance → added engagement → added goals
- Culture Amp: Started engagement → added performance
- BambooHR: Started HRIS → added performance → added hiring

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
□ Which competitors started where we started?
□ What modules did they add? In what order?
□ How long did expansion take?
□ What was customer reception? (from reviews)
□ Did they build or acquire modules?

2. UPMARKET READINESS ANALYSIS (HR Compliance Focus)

TO SERVE 1,000+ EMPLOYEE COMPANIES (Enterprise):

MUST-HAVE FEATURES:
□ SSO (Okta, Azure AD) - Security team requirement
□ SCIM (automated user provisioning)
□ SOC 2 Type II compliance (InfoSec requirement)
□ Custom reporting (HRIS integrations)
□ API access (IT team requirement)
□ Role-based access controls (complex org structures)

MUST-HAVE COMPLIANCE (US Enterprise):
□ EEOC reporting (equal employment opportunity)
□ ADA compliance (Americans with Disabilities Act)
□ OFCCP compliance (if government contractors)
□ State-specific labor laws (CA, NY, etc.)

MUST-HAVE COMPLIANCE (India Enterprise):
□ ISO 27001 certification
□ PF/ESI at scale (10,000+ employees)
□ Multi-state operations (different state labor laws)
□ Large enterprise payroll complexity

COMPETITOR RESEARCH:
□ When did Culture Amp add enterprise features?
□ What compliance did Lattice need for Fortune 500?
□ How long did upmarket move take?

TIMELINE ESTIMATE:
- SSO/SCIM: 3-4 months engineering
- SOC 2: 6-12 months (audit process)
- Enterprise features: 6-9 months
- TOTAL: 12-18 months to be enterprise-ready

3. WIN/LOSS ANALYSIS (HR Tech Nuances)

Interview 20 customers (10 won, 10 lost)

HR TECH WIN/LOSS QUESTIONS:
- "Which other vendors did you evaluate?"
- "What was your decision-making process?" (committee? timeframe?)
- "Who was involved in decision?" (HR + Finance + IT + Legal?)
- "What almost made you choose [Competitor]?"
- "How important was compliance/security?" (1-10 scale)
- "How important was hands-on support?" (1-10 scale)
- "What's your relationship with vendor?" (transactional or partnership?)

PATTERN RECOGNITION (HR Tech Specific):

WE WIN WHEN:
✅ Mid-market (200-800 employees)
✅ Budget-conscious ($3-5/employee budget)
✅ Want hands-on support (not self-serve)
✅ HR team is small (1-3 people)
✅ Need fast implementation (<6 weeks)

WE LOSE WHEN:
❌ Enterprise (1,000+ employees) - lack SSO, SCIM
❌ Global (need GDPR, EU compliance)
❌ Complex hierarchy (role-based access insufficient)
❌ IT-led buying (they want API-first, we're UI-first)
❌ Want "platform" (we're point solution)

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
- Build SSO/SCIM for enterprise (6-month roadmap)
- Add GDPR compliance for EU (9-month roadmap)
- Partner with HRIS vendors (can't build full platform)
- Double down on mid-market (200-800 employees)
- Emphasize customer success (differentiation)
```

### **Series B HR Tech: Tool Stack**

```
MONTHLY BUDGET: $300-600

TIER 1 (ESSENTIAL):
□ LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99/mo)
  → WHY: HR leader org charts, decision maker identification
  → HR TECH SPECIFIC: Track CHRO moves, HR team expansions

□ Crunchbase Pro ($29/mo)
  → WHY: HR Tech funding landscape, M&A activity
  → HR TECH SPECIFIC: Watch consolidation (lots of M&A in HR Tech)

TIER 2 (SHOULD-HAVE):
□ G2 Track ($150/mo)
  → WHY: Monitor competitor reviews, track review sentiment
  → HR TECH SPECIFIC: HR buyers rely heavily on G2 (conservative buyers)

SKIP FOR NOW:
❌ SimilarWeb ($125/mo) - Less relevant for HR Tech (not PLG)
❌ Ahrefs ($99/mo) - HR Tech = sales-led, SEO less critical

TOTAL: $280-350/month (conservative for HR Tech)
```

---

## **B3: HR Tech @ Series C+ (Compliance & Strategic Intelligence)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $50M+ ARR, 800+ employees
- Stage: Series C/D, preparing for IPO or acquisition
- Team: Competitive Intelligence (2 FTE) + Compliance (2 FTE)
- Budget: $100K-200K/year (compliance mandates higher spend)
- Stakeholders: Board, Legal, Compliance, C-suite
```

### **Why HR Tech Enterprise Research is Unique:**

```
SALES TECH ENTERPRISE RESEARCH:
Focus: Market position, M&A targets, feature parity

HR TECH ENTERPRISE RESEARCH:
Focus: Regulatory compliance, audit readiness, data security
  + all the Sales Tech stuff

ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY:
- SOC 2 Type II mandatory (can't sell enterprise without it)
- GDPR if EU (€20M fines for violations)
- HIPAA if health benefits (healthcare data)
- ISO 27001 for global enterprise
- Legal review of ALL competitive claims
```

### **Quarterly Research Cadence (HR Tech Specific)**

**Q1: Compliance Competitive Benchmark**

```
RESEARCH QUESTION: How do we compare on compliance/security?

COMPETITOR COMPLIANCE AUDIT:
For top 10 competitors, research:
□ SOC 2 Type II: Do they have it? (check website)
□ ISO 27001: Certified? (check trust center)
□ GDPR: Do they serve EU? Compliant?
□ HIPAA: Do they handle health data?
□ State-specific: CA CCPA, NY SHIELD Act?

COMPLIANCE GAP ANALYSIS:
Workday: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA ✅✅✅✅
BambooHR: SOC 2, GDPR ✅✅
Culture Amp: SOC 2, GDPR ✅✅
Us: SOC 2, GDPR ✅✅
Gap: Need ISO 27001 for global enterprise

INVESTMENT NEEDED:
- ISO 27001 certification: $50K-100K + 9-12 months
- HIPAA compliance: $30K-60K + 6 months
- Ongoing compliance: $200K/year (team + audits)

BOARD DELIVERABLE:
"Compliance Competitive Analysis & Investment Recommendation"
```

**Q2: M&A Target Analysis (HR Tech Module Strategy)**

```
HR TECH M&A IS DIFFERENT:

SALES TECH M&A:
- Acquire competitors for market share
- Acquire complementary tech (e.g., Gong buying Forecast)

HR TECH M&A:
- Acquire modules to become platform
- Example: UKG acquired Ultimate + Kronos
- Example: iCIMS acquired TextRecruit, Jobvite

ACQUISITION THESIS:
We're strong in: Employee Engagement
Missing modules: Performance Management, Learning, Recruiting

TARGET IDENTIFICATION:
□ Performance Management startups (Series A-B)
  - Small Improvements
  - Reflektive (acquired by Lumin)
  - 7Geese (acquired by Paycor)

□ Learning platforms (Series A-B)
  - EdApp
  - TalentLMS
  - [Smaller players]

DUE DILIGENCE (HR Tech Specific):
□ Customer overlap: Would acquisition cause churn?
□ Data portability: Can we migrate customer data?
□ Compliance transfer: Do their certifications transfer?
□ HR community perception: Would acquisition be well-received?

VALUATION BENCHMARKS:
- HR Tech M&A multiples: 8-15× ARR (higher than Sales Tech)
- Why: Sticky (hard to switch), compliance moats, relationship-driven
```

**Q3: Analyst Relations & Industry Positioning**

```
HR TECH ANALYSTS (Different from Sales Tech):

PRIMARY ANALYSTS:
□ Gartner (HCM Magic Quadrant)
□ Forrester (Employee Experience Wave)
□ Nucleus Research (ROI-focused)
□ Bersin/Josh Bersin (HR thought leader, not traditional analyst)

ANALYST RELATIONS STRATEGY:
- Quarterly briefings (share roadmap, customer wins)
- Annual Gartner MQ participation (if eligible)
- Sponsor research: "State of Employee Engagement 2026"
- Speaking: HR Tech Conference, Josh Bersin events

CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (HR Tech):
- SHRM Preferred Provider (HR credibility)
- Brandon Hall Excellence Awards (industry recognition)
- Great Place to Work Certified (practice what you preach)

WHY THIS MATTERS IN HR TECH:
HR buyers trust:
1. Peer recommendations (other CHROs)
2. Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
3. Industry associations (SHRM)
4. Awards/recognition

Sales Tech buyers trust:
1. Product trials (test it yourself)
2. Peer reviews (G2)
3. ROI data (does it work?)
```

**Q4: IPO Readiness / Market Positioning**

```
PUBLIC HR TECH COMPARABLES:

PUBLIC COMPANIES:
- Workday (HCM platform, $60B+ market cap)
- UKG (private equity, not pure public comp)
- Paycom, Paylocity (payroll + HR)
- ADP (payroll giant, legacy)

RECENT IPOs:
- [Research recent HR Tech IPOs]

BENCHMARKING METRICS:
□ ARR growth (us vs public comps)
□ Net revenue retention (target: >110%)
□ Gross margin (target: >75% for SaaS)
□ Operating margin (path to profitability)
□ Customer retention (critical in HR Tech)

HR TECH SPECIFIC METRICS:
□ Employees under management (how many employees use your platform)
□ Customer company size (SMB vs Enterprise mix)
□ Module adoption (single vs multi-module customers)
□ CSAT/NPS (relationship-driven, loyalty matters)

INVESTOR NARRATIVE:
"Employee Engagement Platform for Mid-Market
 Trusted by 800 companies, 250,000 employees
 Net retention 118%, Rule of 40 compliant
 Path to profitability in 18 months"
```

### **HR Tech Series C+ Tool Stack**

# 📊 SECTION C: FINTECH COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

**When To Use This Section:**
- Your product: Payments, expense management, corporate cards, payroll, neo-banking
- Your competitors: Razorpay, Paytm, PhonePe (India), Stripe, Brex, Ramp (US)
- Your buyers: CFOs, Finance leaders, Controllers
- Your go-to-market: Sales-led (finance is risk-averse)
- **CRITICAL**: Highly regulated industry, compliance-first

---

## **C1: Fintech @ Series A (Conservative, Compliance-First)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $2M-8M ARR, 20-100 employees
- Stage: Series A
- You: Founder (often ex-finance/banking background)
- Budget: $0-500/month (compliance eats budget)
- Regulatory: RBI licensed or applying for license (India)
```

### **FINTECH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT**

**Critical Differences from Sales Tech / HR Tech:**

```
SALES TECH:
✅ Can be aggressive
✅ Fast experimentation
✅ Attack competitors
✅ Share metrics openly
Risk: Low (worst case: lose customers)

HR TECH:
⚠️ Must be professional
⚠️ Cannot attack competitors
⚠️ Relationship-driven
Risk: Medium (people data sensitive)

FINTECH:
🔴 MUST be conservative
🔴 NEVER attack competitors (could trigger regulatory review)
🔴 CANNOT share metrics without legal approval
🔴 CANNOT make unverified claims (financial advertising rules)
Risk: EXTREME (regulatory fines, license revocation, criminal liability)
```

### **Fintech Regulatory Landscape (India)**

**Before ANY Competitive Research, Understand:**

```
INDIA FINTECH REGULATIONS:

RBI (Reserve Bank of India):
□ Payment Aggregator License (if processing payments)
□ NBFC License (if lending)
□ Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) License (wallets)
□ Account Aggregator License (financial data)

Compliance Requirements:
□ KYC (Know Your Customer) - mandatory
□ AML (Anti-Money Laundering) - mandatory
□ Data Localization (store data in India)
□ RBI reporting (monthly/quarterly)

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:
- License suspension or revocation
- ₹1 crore+ fines
- Criminal charges (directors liable)
- Cannot process transactions (business shutdown)

THIS CHANGES COMPETITIVE RESEARCH:
- Cannot share user transaction data
- Cannot make unverified ROI claims
- Cannot criticize competitors publicly
- Legal review MANDATORY for all competitive claims
```

### **Series A Fintech Research: Ultra-Conservative**

**Week 1: Competitive Landscape (Regulatory Lens)**

```
DAY 1-2: License & Compliance Mapping

FOR EACH COMPETITOR:
□ What licenses do they have? (check RBI website)
□ Are they compliant? (any RBI actions against them?)
□ How long did licensing take? (timeline for us)
□ What compliance do they highlight? (trust signals)

INDIA FINTECH COMPETITORS:

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT:
- Happay (CRED acquired, ₹180M exit)
- Zoho Expense (Zoho suite)
- Fyle (Series B, expense automation)

CORPORATE CARDS:
- EnKash (RBI-licensed)
- Volopay (Singapore-based, India operations)
- Pazcare (expense + benefits)

PAYMENT PROCESSING:
- Razorpay (unicorn, payment gateway)
- Cashfree (payment aggregator)
- PayU (Naspers-owned)

COMPLIANCE COMPETITIVE INTEL:
Company | RBI License | SOC 2 | ISO 27001 | PCI DSS | Data Localization
Razorpay | ✅ PA | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Happay | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
[Us] | ⏳ Applying | ❌ | ❌ | ⏳ | ✅

GAP: Need SOC 2, ISO 27001 before enterprise sales
Timeline: 12-18 months for full compliance stack

DAY 3-4: Conservative Pricing Research

FINTECH PRICING CHALLENGES:
- Often bundled (hard to compare)
- Enterprise pricing hidden
- Regulatory fees not disclosed
- Transaction-based + subscription hybrid

RESEARCH SOURCES (Fintech-Safe):
□ Public websites (pricing pages if available)
□ G2 reviews mentioning price (user-reported, safe to cite)
□ Press releases (funding announcements mention ACV)
□ Your own customer interviews (first-party data, compliant)

WHAT YOU CANNOT DO:
❌ Scrape competitor pricing from private dashboards
❌ Pose as customer to get pricing (fraud)
❌ Use competitor's confidential data

PRICING BENCHMARKS (India Expense Management):
- Happay: ₹150-300/employee/month (from reviews)
- Zoho: ₹100-200/employee/month
- Fyle: ₹200-400/employee/month

YOUR POSITIONING:
"Compliant expense management for Indian SMBs
 ₹150-250/employee/month"

NOT: "50% cheaper than Happay" (unless verified and legal-approved)

DAY 5: Positioning (Risk-Averse, Compliance-First)

FINTECH POSITIONING PRINCIPLES:

✅ DO EMPHASIZE:
- "RBI-compliant" (if licensed)
- "Bank-grade security"
- "SOC 2 certified" (if have it)
- "Trusted by [X] companies"
- "Backed by [reputable investors]"

❌ NEVER SAY:
- "Better than [Competitor]"
- "Competitor X has security issues"
- "Fastest-growing fintech" (unless verified by 3rd party)
- "Save [X]%" (unless calculated, disclosed methodology)

EXAMPLE POSITIONING:
"RBI-Compliant Expense Management for Indian SMBs
 Bank-grade security, SOC 2 certified, trusted by 500+ companies"

CONSERVATIVE BATTLE CARD:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VS. HAPPAY (CRED-Acquired Incumbent)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WHEN THEY COME UP:                          │
│ • Enterprise deals (their strength)         │
│ • CRED ecosystem (card + expense bundled)   │
│                                             │
│ RESPECTFUL POSITIONING:                     │
│ ✅ "Happay is excellent for enterprise      │
│     We focus on SMB (50-500 employees)"     │
│ ✅ "Both of us are RBI-compliant            │
│     We offer more flexible pricing for SMB" │
│ ✅ "Great product with strong backing       │
│     We provide hands-on support for growing │
│     finance teams"                          │
│                                             │
│ NEVER SAY (Legal Risk):                     │
│ ❌ "Happay is too expensive"                 │
│ ❌ "Happay has compliance issues"            │
│ ❌ "We're more secure than Happay"           │
│ ❌ "Customers switch from Happay to us"      │
│    (unless you have written testimonials)   │
│                                             │
│ WHY EXTREME CAUTION:                        │
│ - Fintech community is tiny in India       │
│ - CRED is well-connected (Kunal Shah)      │
│ - Negative positioning could trigger legal  │

## **C2: Fintech @ Series B (Strategic Compliance + Expansion)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $15M-40M ARR, 200-500 employees
- Stage: Series B, expanding product lines or geography
- You: Product Marketing Manager or Strategy Lead
- Budget: $3K-8K/month for research
- Compliance: Fully licensed, SOC 2, considering ISO 27001
```

### **Series B Fintech Research Questions:**

```
TYPICAL SERIES B QUESTIONS:

SALES TECH @ SERIES B:
"Should we move upmarket?"
"Should we expand to US?"

HR TECH @ SERIES B:
"Should we add performance module?"
"Can we serve enterprise?"

FINTECH @ SERIES B:
"Should we apply for lending license?" (NBFC)
"Can we expand to UAE/Singapore?" (different regulators)
"Should we launch corporate cards?" (new product = new compliance)
"Can we partner with banks?" (co-branding, regulatory implications)
```

### **Week 1-2: Regulatory Expansion Analysis**

```
RESEARCH FOCUS: New Product Line = New Regulations

SCENARIO: We do expense management, want to add corporate cards

COMPLIANCE RESEARCH:
□ What additional licenses needed? (RBI: PPI license)
□ What do competitors have? (Check EnKash, Volopay licenses)
□ Timeline to get license? (12-18 months for PPI)
□ Compliance costs? (₹50L-1Cr for license + ongoing)
□ Risk? (if license denied, wasted investment)

COMPETITOR LICENSE MAPPING:

Company | Expense Mgmt | Corporate Cards | Lending | Payroll
Happay | ✅ | ✅ (via CRED) | ❌ | ❌
EnKash | ✅ | ✅ RBI PPI | ❌ | ❌
Volopay | ✅ | ✅ Singapore | ❌ | ❌
[Us] | ✅ | ⏳ Want | ❌ | ❌

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:
Option 1: Build in-house (12-18 months, ₹1-2Cr investment)
Option 2: Partner with licensed issuer (faster, lower risk)
Option 3: Acquire competitor with license (expensive, fast)

RECOMMENDATION: Partner while applying for license (hybrid approach)
```

### **Geographic Expansion: India → UAE/Singapore**

```
RESEARCH QUESTION: Should we expand beyond India?

REGULATORY COMPARISON:

INDIA (RBI):
- License types: PA, PPI, NBFC, AA
- Timeline: 12-24 months per license
- Difficulty: High (stringent requirements)
- Data: Must be localized in India
- Language: English + local languages

UAE (DFSA, ADGM):
- License: Payment Services License
- Timeline: 6-12 months
- Difficulty: Medium (easier than India)
- Data: Can be in UAE or secure cloud
- Language: English + Arabic

SINGAPORE (MAS):
- License: Payment Services License
- Timeline: 6-9 months
- Difficulty: Medium-Low (clear process)
- Data: Can be anywhere (cloud-friendly)
- Language: English

COMPETITOR EXPANSION PATTERNS:

Razorpay:
- India (2014) → Malaysia (2019) → Not very successful outside India

Cashfree:
- India-focused, minimal international

Volopay:
- Singapore-first → India expansion
- Dual regulatory compliance

MARKET SIZING (UAE Corporate Spend):

Bottom-up:
- SMBs in UAE: ~50,000 companies
- Corporate card TAM: $200-300M
vs India: $1.5-2B (5-7× larger)

RECOMMENDATION:
India market still underpenetrated
Focus on India until $50M ARR, then expand
Exception: If UAE investor insists or strategic partnership
```

OUR GAPS:
❌ No Tier 1 references (chicken-egg problem)
❌ Not battle-tested at scale (max 5,000 reps)
❌ Limited integrations (no SAP connector yet)
❌ No SOC 2 (need 12 months)
❌ Small support team (can't dedicate account team)

PATH TO TIER 1:

STEP 1: Win Regional Tier 1 (6-12 months)
- Target: Large regional brand (e.g., MTR Foods, Haldiram)
- Size: 2,000-5,000 field reps (test our scale)
- Benefit: Build scale story, get enterprise reference

STEP 2: Get SOC 2 + ISO 27001 (12 months parallel)
- Investment: ₹40L-60L
- Benefit: Meet enterprise security requirements

STEP 3: Build SAP Connector (6 months)
- Why: Tier 1 CPG uses SAP for distribution
- Investment: 2 engineers × 6 months
- Benefit: Integration with Tier 1 systems

STEP 4: Pilot with Tier 1 (12-18 months)
- Approach: Regional pilot first (one state)

## **Worked Examples: Multi-Dimensional Scenarios**

### **Example 1: Sales Tech Founder, Series A, India → US Expansion**

```
SCENARIO:
- Company: AI sales coaching, $3M ARR, 35 employees
- Stage: Series A (just raised $5M)
- Current: 50 customers in India (SMB B2B SaaS)
- Question: "Should we expand to US now or wait?"

RESEARCH PLAN:

WEEK 1: US Market Landscape
□ Identify US competitors (Gong, Chorus, Revenue.io)
□ Price benchmarking (3-4× higher than India)
□ Customer interviews (5 US sales leaders)
□ Question: "Would you buy from India-based company?"

WEEK 2: Go/No-Go Analysis

PROS (Go to US):
✅ 7× larger market (15K SMB SaaS vs 2K in India)
✅ Higher ACVs ($10K-20K vs $3K-5K in India)
✅ Less competitive at SMB (Gong focuses on enterprise)
✅ Investors want US traction

CONS (Wait):
❌ Need US team (sales, support = $300K-500K/year)
❌ Brand unknown (India success doesn't transfer)
❌ Time zone challenge (India team supporting US customers)
❌ Payment processing (Stripe US vs India)
❌ India market still underpenetrated (2K companies, only 50 customers)

CALCULATION:
US Expansion Cost Year 1: $500K (team + marketing)
India Deepening Cost Year 1: $200K (same team)

US Upside: 10 customers × $15K = $150K ARR
India Upside: 30 customers × $4K = $120K ARR

ROI: Similar, but India has less execution risk

RECOMMENDATION: Focus India until $10M ARR
Reason:
- Still early in India (50/2000 = 2.5% penetration)
- US requires significant investment
- India market understands our pain points better
- Build case studies in India first, then leverage for US

EXCEPTION: If US strategic investor leads Series B, then expand
```

### **Example 2: HR Tech PMM, Series B, Module Expansion Decision**

```
SCENARIO:
- Company: Employee engagement platform, $18M ARR
- Stage: Series B (400 customers, mid-market focus)
- Current: Just engagement surveys + pulse
- Question: "Add performance management or recruiting module?"

RESEARCH PLAN (2 Weeks):

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:

Performance Management:
□ Competitors: Lattice, 15Five, BetterUp
□ Market: Crowded but growing
□ Customer need: 67% of customers ask for it (from surveys)
□ Build vs Buy: 12 months to build, or acquire for $10M-20M
□ Cannibalization: Low (complements engagement)

Recruiting:
□ Competitors: Lever, Greenhouse, Ashby
□ Market: Very crowded, strong incumbents
□ Customer need: 31% ask for it
□ Build vs Buy: 18 months to build, complex
□ Cannibalization: Medium (different buyer - TA vs HR)

WIN/LOSS ANALYSIS:
Interviewed 20 customers:
- Lost 8 deals to Lattice (reason: "Wanted engagement + performance")
- Lost 2 deals to Greenhouse (reason: "Recruiting was priority")

CUSTOMER SURVEYS:
"If we added one module, which would you want?"
- Performance management: 68%
- Recruiting: 23%
- Learning & development: 9%

DECISION: Build Performance Management
Reason:
- Higher customer demand (68% vs 23%)
- Reduces churn to Lattice
- Easier to build (12 vs 18 months)
- Natural adjacency (same buyer = CHRO)
- Recruiting too competitive (Lever, Greenhouse mature)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Timeline: 12 months to launch
- Investment: $800K-1.2M (4 engineers × 12 months)
- Go-to-market: Existing customers first (upsell)
- Pricing: +$2/employee/month for performance add-on
```

### **Example 3: Fintech CMO, Series C, M&A Target Identification**

```
SCENARIO:
- Company: Corporate expense management, $45M ARR
- Stage: Series C (preparing for Series D/IPO)
- Current: Expense management only, want to expand
- Board directive: "Acquire complementary fintech to become platform"

RESEARCH PLAN (4 Weeks):

WEEK 1: Define Acquisition Thesis
Options:
1. Corporate cards (compete with EnKash, Volopay)
2. Payroll (compete with Razorpay Payroll, Zoho)
3. Procurement (compete with Procol, Kissflow)

STRATEGIC FIT ANALYSIS:

Corporate Cards:
□ Customer overlap: High (95% of customers want cards)
□ Revenue synergy: High (attach rate 70-80%)
□ Regulatory: Need RBI PPI license (or acquire licensed)
□ Competition: Medium (EnKash, Volopay)

Payroll:
□ Customer overlap: Medium (60% have <200 employees)
□ Revenue synergy: Medium (attach rate 40-50%)
□ Regulatory: Complex (state labor laws, compliance)
□ Competition: High (Razorpay, Zoho, many others)

Procurement:
□ Customer overlap: Low (30% need procurement)
□ Revenue synergy: Low (attach rate 20-30%)
□ Regulatory: Minimal
□ Competition: Low (early market)

DECISION: Acquire Corporate Cards Player
Reason: Highest customer overlap + revenue synergy

WEEK 2-3: Target Identification

TARGET CRITERIA:
□ RBI PPI licensed (saves us 18 months)
□ $5M-15M ARR (affordable at $40M-100M valuation)
□ 1,000-5,000 cards issued (proof of concept)
□ Complementary customer base (not too much overlap)
□ Strong technology (can integrate in 6 months)

TARGET SHORTLIST:
1. Company A: $8M ARR, RBI licensed, 3,000 cards
2. Company B: $12M ARR, not licensed (partner model)
3. Company C: $6M ARR, RBI licensed, 2,000 cards

WEEK 4: Due Diligence (Company A)

LICENSE VERIFICATION:
□ RBI PPI license: Valid until 2027 ✅
□ Compliance record: Clean (no RBI actions) ✅
□ License transferable: Yes (with RBI approval, 3-6 months) ✅

CUSTOMER ANALYSIS:
□ Total customers: 180
□ Overlap with us: 15 customers (8%)
□ Customer retention: 89% (good)
□ Average cards per customer: 17 cards

TECHNOLOGY:
□ Core platform: Modern (Node.js, AWS)
□ Integration complexity: Medium (6-9 months)
□ Technical debt: Manageable

VALUATION:
□ ARR: $8M
□ Growth: 120% YoY
□ Burn: $800K/month
□ Asking price: 8-10× ARR = $64M-80M
□ Our offer: $60M (7.5× ARR)

RECOMMENDATION: Acquire Company A for $60M
Synergy case:
- Year 1: Upsell cards to our 1,200 customers
- Attach rate assumption: 40%
- New ARR: 480 customers × $15K avg = $7.2M
- Acquisition pays for itself in 8-10 years (vs building = 18 months delay)
```

## **Common Research Mistakes & How to Avoid Them**

### **Mistake 1: "Industry-Agnostic Research" (One-Size-Fits-All)**

```
WRONG APPROACH:
"I'll use the same battle card template for Sales Tech, HR Tech, and Fintech"

WHY IT FAILS:
- Sales Tech: Can be aggressive ("We're 10× cheaper than Gong")
- HR Tech: Must be professional ("We're built for mid-market")
- Fintech: Must be conservative ("Both of us are RBI-compliant...")

CORRECT APPROACH:
Use industry-specific positioning frameworks:
→ Sales Tech → Sections A1-A3
→ HR Tech → Sections B1-B3
→ Fintech → Sections C1-C3
→ Ops Tech → Sections D1-D3
```

### **Mistake 2: "Stage-Agnostic Budgets" (Wrong Tools for Stage)**

```
WRONG APPROACH:
"Series A company buying Gartner subscription ($35K/year)"

WHY IT FAILS:
- Series A budget: $0-500/month total marketing tools
- Gartner: $35K/year = 70% of annual tool budget
- ROI: Gartner useful for enterprise sales (Series C+), not early-stage

SERIES A TOOLS: Free + LinkedIn Sales Nav ($99/mo)
SERIES B TOOLS: Add Crunchbase Pro, SimilarWeb ($250-350/mo)
SERIES C+ TOOLS: Now justify Gartner, Klue, ZoomInfo

CORRECT APPROACH:
Match tool spend to stage → See budget tables in each section
```

### **Mistake 3: "Geography-Agnostic Competitors" (Wrong Comp Set)**

```
WRONG APPROACH:
India sales tech startup positioning against Gong/Outreach only

WHY IT FAILS:
- Gong: $500M+ valuation, US-focused, enterprise
- Real competition in India: Wingman, local startups, price-sensitive
- Customers ask: "Why not Wingman?" not "Why not Gong?"

CORRECT APPROACH:
PRIMARY COMP SET (Direct competition):
- India-based competitors at similar stage
- Example: Wingman for sales tech, Darwinbox for HR Tech

SECONDARY COMP SET (Aspiration):
- Global players (Gong, Lattice) for positioning
- "We're Gong-quality at Indian pricing"
```

### **Mistake 4: "Ignoring Regulatory Differences" (Fintech/HR Tech)**

```
WRONG APPROACH:
Copy US Fintech research playbook for India

WHY IT FAILS:
US Fintech:
- Regulation: State-by-state, relatively open
- Innovation: Encouraged (regulatory sandboxes)

India Fintech:
- Regulation: RBI central control, strict
- Innovation: Controlled (must have license first)
- Compliance: Data localization mandatory

CORRECT APPROACH:
Research regulatory landscape FIRST, then competitors
→ See Section C1 (Fintech regulatory overview)
```

### **Mistake 5: "Vanity Metrics in Market Sizing" (Top-Down Only)**

```
WRONG APPROACH:
"Global sales tech market is $10B, India is 2%, so India = $200M"

WHY IT FAILS:
- Top-down often overestimates
- Doesn't account for price differences (India pays 30-50% of US prices)
- Doesn't validate with bottom-up

CORRECT APPROACH:
ALWAYS triangulate:
1. Bottom-up: Count companies in ICP × estimated deal size
2. Top-down: Global market × geography % × category %
3. Validation: Interview industry experts, "Does $X feel right?"

If bottom-up = $50M and top-down = $200M:
→ Use conservative middle ground ($75M-100M)
→ Document assumptions clearly
```

## **Troubleshooting Guide: Research Challenges**

### **Issue 1: "Can't find competitor pricing information"**

```
DIAGNOSIS:
□ Checked competitor websites? (pricing page)
□ Checked G2 reviews? (users mention price)
□ Searched "[competitor] pricing" on Google?
□ Asked in communities (Reddit, Slack groups)?

SOLUTIONS:

SHORT-TERM (This Week):
□ Use G2 review search: filter by "pricing" mentions
□ Example: "Gong pricing" in reviews → users say "$1,500-4,000/seat"
□ Check Reddit: r/sales, r/saas for user-reported pricing
□ LinkedIn polls: "What do you pay for [category]?"

MEDIUM-TERM (This Month):
□ Interview customers: "Which competitors did you evaluate? What was pricing?"
□ Interview lost deals: "Why did you choose [Competitor]? Was price a factor?"
□ Sales Nav: Find people who work at competitor, connect, ask (subtly)

LONG-TERM (Next Quarter):
□ Commission research: Hire firm to do competitive pricing study
□ Partner pricing: If you partner with competitor, you'll learn pricing
□ Board connections: Investors often know competitor pricing

WORKAROUNDS:
If still can't find pricing:
□ Estimate based on: Category averages (G2 pricing filter)
□ Back-calculate: If competitor raised $X, has Y employees, burns $Z, estimate ACV
□ Disclaimer: "Estimated pricing based on industry benchmarks and user reports"
```

### **Issue 2: "Competitor in different geography (India vs US)"**

```
DIAGNOSIS:
□ India company expanding to US?
□ US company entering India?
□ Need to compare both markets?

SOLUTIONS:

SCENARIO A: India Company → US Expansion

Step 1: Identify US Equivalents
- Don't compete with Gong directly (you're unknown in US)
- Find: Mid-tier US players (similar stage to you)
- Example: India sales tech → Compare to Revenue.io (Series B) not Gong (unicorn)

Step 2: Price Expectations
- India: $3K-5K annual for sales tech
- US: $10K-20K annual (2-4× higher)
- Adjust your pricing up for US market

Step 3: Positioning
- Don't say: "We're Indian alternative to Gong"
- Do say: "Global sales tech, trusted by [India customers], expanding to US"

SCENARIO B: US Company → India Entry

Step 1: Identify Local Competition
- Don't ignore local players (they have price advantage)
- Find: India startups in your space
- Example: Gong entering India → compete with Wingman (local, cheaper)

Step 2: Price Adaptation
- US: $20K/year for Gong
- India: Must price at $6K-10K (0.3-0.5× of US price)
- Or: Risk being "too expensive for India market"

Step 3: Localization
- Language: Hindi + English minimum
- Support: India time zones (IST)
- Payments: Rupee pricing, Indian payment methods
```

### **Issue 3: "No public information on competitor (stealth mode)"**

```
DIAGNOSIS:
□ Competitor is pre-launch or stealth?
□ No website, no reviews, minimal info?
□ Only rumors or whispers in market?

SOLUTIONS:

SIGNALS TO TRACK:

LinkedIn Signals:
□ Company page: How many employees? Growing?
□ Job postings: What roles? (Hiring SDRs = going to market soon)
□ Employee profiles: What are they building? (LinkedIn posts)
□ Founder posts: Any hints about product?

Crunchbase:
□ Funding: How much raised? When?
□ Investors: Who backed them? (signals their focus)
□ Founders: Their background (hints at product direction)

GitHub:
□ Public repos: Any open-source components?
□ Employee commits: What tech stack?

Y Combinator / Accelerators:
□ YC company directory: Their one-liner description
□ Demo day pitches: Sometimes recorded/transcribed

NETWORK INTELLIGENCE:
□ Shared investors: Ask your investors about competitor
□ Shared customers: Ask "Have you heard of [Competitor]?"
□ Industry events: Attend where they might present
□ Sales team: Lost a deal to them? Interview the customer

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
If minimal info:
□ Don't speculate in battle cards
□ Focus on: "Emerging competitor, watching closely"
□ Monitor: Set Google Alerts, track their LinkedIn
□ Update: Quarterly reviews of stealth competitors
```

### **Issue 4: "Conflicting data from multiple sources"**

```
DIAGNOSIS:
□ G2 says competitor is $5K, Reddit says $10K?
□ Crunchbase says $20M ARR, press release says $15M?
□ Analyst report says X, our research says Y?

SOLUTIONS:

EVALUATE SOURCE CREDIBILITY:

TIER 1 (Highest Credibility):
□ Official company announcements (press releases)
□ Regulatory filings (RBI, SEC if public)
□ Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester - but expensive)

TIER 2 (Medium Credibility):
□ Industry publications (TechCrunch, ET Tech)
□ Customer testimonials (G2 verified reviews)
□ Investor announcements (funding rounds)

TIER 3 (Lower Credibility):
□ Anonymous reviews (unverified)
□ Reddit/community posts (rumors)
□ Third-party estimates (e.g., Sensor Tower DAU estimates)

RECONCILIATION APPROACH:

Example: Competitor pricing conflict
- G2 review: "We pay $5K/year" (1 data point)
- Reddit: "Quoted at $10K" (another data point)
- Website: No pricing (not helpful)

Resolution:
1. More data: Read 20+ G2 reviews, find pricing mentions
2. Find range: "$5K-10K annually depending on seats, features"
3. Present as range: "Estimated $5K-10K based on user reports"
4. Confidence level: "Medium confidence (based on user reports, not official)"

DISCLOSURE IN REPORTS:
"Competitor pricing: $5K-10K estimated annual
Source: G2 user reviews (n=12), Reddit discussions (n=3)
Confidence: Medium (no official pricing available)
Last updated: [Date]"
```

### **Issue 5: "Board wants faster research (can't spend 2 weeks)"**

```

□ Urgent board meeting (3 days notice)?
□ Quick competitive snapshot needed?
□ Can't do 2-week comprehensive research?
