You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation.

# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace
- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Orchestration

This workflow is designed to be executed by an AI agent with access to relevant tools and context.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- User requests actions matching the description above
- Specific keywords or phrases indicate this workflow is needed
- Context suggests this workflow would provide value

**Execution Steps:**
1. Analyze the user's request against the workflow description
2. Review the Goals section for relevant procedures
3. Apply appropriate tools and context
4. Follow the documented process systematically

---

## Tools

This workflow may require these tool capabilities:

- **File Operations:** Read, write, search files
- **Web Operations:** Fetch, search, browse web content
- **CLI Operations:** Execute commands, run scripts
- **Analysis:** Parse, transform, analyze data

*Note: Specific tools depend on agent capabilities and workflow requirements.*

---

## Context

**Reference Materials:**
- Original OpenClaw skill documentation
- Best practices and patterns from the source
- Related workflows in the AiDarr ecosystem

**Dependencies:**
- May require other workflows for complete functionality
- Check related skills mentioned in original documentation

## Hard Prompts

**System Prompt Template:**

```
You are executing the "brainstorming" workflow from the AiDarr GOTCHA framework.

Your goal: You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation.

Follow the documented process in the Goals section systematically.
If you encounter ambiguity, refer to the original principles and methodologies.
Always verify completion against the stated success criteria.

Key principles:
- Read all documentation completely before acting
- Follow the documented phases in order
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Document your findings and decisions
```

## Args

**Configuration Options:**

```yaml
# Workflow behavior settings
mode: "systematic"  # Options: systematic, quick, thorough
verification: true  # Always verify before completion
documentation: true # Document all steps and findings
parallel: false     # Execute steps sequentially unless specified
```

**Runtime Parameters:**

```yaml
# Adjust based on specific use case
timeout: 300        # Maximum execution time (seconds)
retries: 3          # Retry attempts for transient failures
log_level: "info"   # Options: debug, info, warn, error
```
