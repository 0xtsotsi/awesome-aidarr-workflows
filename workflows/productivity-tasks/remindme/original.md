Set reminders in Telegram using normal human language.

## 🚀 How to Use

Just type what you want and when:

- `/remindme drink water in 10m`
- `/remindme tomorrow 9am standup`
- `/remindme next monday call mom`
- `/remindme in 2 hours turn off oven`

No menus. No setup. No thinking.

## ✨ Why It’s Good

- **Natural language:** say it like a human
- **Fast:** reminder is scheduled instantly
- **Accurate:** runs on OpenClaw cron
- **Safe in groups:** reminders don’t get lost

## 🛠️ How It Works

Runs a background process that schedules reminders reliably through OpenClaw.
