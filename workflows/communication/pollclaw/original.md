Pollclaw is now **MeetLark** — same service, new name, at [meetlark.ai](https://meetlark.ai).

Use the **coordinate-meeting** skill instead. It does everything Pollclaw did: create scheduling polls, collect votes from humans and agents, and find the best meeting time.

## How to switch

Ask your agent to use the `coordinate-meeting` skill, or just say:

```
"Schedule a meeting with the team next week"
"Find a time for a 1:1 with Sarah"
```
